# **Milestone Project 2** 

## Building the site

### Introduction

For my second project I have decide to travel information site for Cambodia as it's a country I enjoyed going to and will be going again. When researching information on Cambodian vacations it was very limited information or outdated or irrelvant infomation(ie. most information out there pertained to what they call "sex tourism"). Khmer people have a rich history and beautiful country, that anyone can enjoy and with this website, I am hoping to do the country justice.


### First steps

- First went to GitHub to start a new project board for my milestone project 2. I have added 8 issues to the to-do section of the board. They have acceptance criteria and tasks with each one prioritised with importance.

- Next stop was Balsamiq, where I made wireframes of the website for different devices.

#### Wireframe for browser window

#### Wireframe for a tablet

![alt text](assets/readmeimages/Screenshot%202025-03-20%20233819.png "Mobile phone window 4")

- Came up with a few names for the site. 
  1. Cambodian Travel Guide.
  2. Khmer Travel Chronicles.
  3. Khmer Explorer.
  4. Cambodia Traveller.
  5. Travel Guide: Cambodia.
  6. Road to Cambodia.
  7. Cambodian Holiday Tips.
Ultimately decided on using Khmer Explorer for the website, as the I felt it showed respect for the Khmer people and culture.

### Testing

#### Bugs/ Issues

##### Known Issues

As seen in my first project the known issues were the images being placed in the carousel and Hero Image. The image would not load even though the link was correct. Sometimes I had to delete the photo from the image folder and then put it back it.

The second issue were the API's as it's the first time using JS, mistakes are made and research was the only was to correct the issues. Use Google Gemini and chatGPT.

#### Google DevTools

![alt text](assets/readmeimages/Screenshot%202025-04-07%20120254.png "Google DevTools") 
 
Both images were resized:

![alt text](assets/readmeimages/Screenshot%202025-04-30%20114748.png "Caption.jpg resized")

![alt text](assets/readmeimages/Screenshot%202025-04-30%20114837.png "angkor-wat-main.jpg resized")

Then re-did the google map api with more research. Using Youtube, Codementor, Stack Overflow and W3Schools. Tried AI search engines like chatGPT and Gemini but made it overcomplicated and not how I wanted the API to behave.

![alt text](assets/readmeimages/Screenshot%202025-05-07%20134720.png "Warning on devtools stays even after changed to the new marker element")

The translator was a bigger issue. The key need to be hidden due to the update on the API. As back end development has not been taught in this stage. There was no way I could keep the translator. So tried a weather API instead.

![alt text](assets/readmeimages/Screenshot%202025-05-09%20003851.png "Weather API")

With the change, the only warning is for deprication for the marker element.

![alt text](assets/readmeimages/Screenshot%202025-05-09%20003851.png "Deprication warning")

#### Lighthouse on Devtools

![alt text](assets/readmeimages/Screenshot%202025-05-09%20005150.png "Lighthouse 1")


Lighthouse with no issues but third party cookies restrictions on my account, so went on incognito mode to see
if it worked without my settings interfering with it.

#### CSS validator(Jigsaw)

Checked the CSS and found 1 error.

![alt text](assets/readmeimages/Screenshot%202025-05-09%20013447.png "CSS validator")

Fixed the error.

![alt text](assets/readmeimages/Screenshot%202025-05-09%20013607.png "CSS validator 2")

#### JS validator(JSHint)

No errors. It's says that there is unused and undefined variables but if i adjust them anyway, the API's don't work.

## Future plans

There are many ways to improve the website to keep current visitors and increase future visitors to interact with the website.

1. Add a newsletter to inform members of news for to Cambodian tourists.
2. Add a member's gallery, for members photo's after vetting to be posted on it's own page with other members
holiday photo's.
3. Add quiz or quizzes on the lanuage, the country or the culture of Cambodia.
4. Add a glossary of animals, flauna and flora of Cambodia.
5. Add a food guide of Cambodian cuisine and the ability for members to comments on dishes.
6. Add a restaurant guide page with menu, locations (If multple locations/ chains stores.), and reviews for review sites.
7. Translation app with text to speech function.(When I have more exprience with API's and securing keys.).
