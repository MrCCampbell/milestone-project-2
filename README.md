# Milestone Project 2 

For my second project I have decide to travel information site for Cambodia as it's a country I enjoyed going to and will be going again. When researching information on Cambodian vacations it was very limited information or outdated or irrelvant infomation(ie. most information out there pertained to what they call "sex tourism"). Khmer people have a rich history and beautiful country, that anyone can enjoy and with this website, I am hoping to do the country justice.














# Coding the website

- I have used the Code Institute's template for this project.
