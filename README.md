# **Milestone Project 2** 

## Building the site

### Introduction

For my second project I have decide to travel information site for Cambodia as it's a country I enjoyed going to and will be going again. When researching information on Cambodian vacations it was very limited information or outdated or irrelvant infomation(ie. most information out there pertained to what they call "sex tourism"). Khmer people have a rich history and beautiful country, that anyone can enjoy and with this website, I am hoping to do the country justice.


### First steps

- First went to GitHub to start a new project board for my milestone project 2. I have added 8 issues to the to-do section of the board. They have acceptance criteria and tasks with each one prioritised with importance.

- Next stop was Balsamiq, where I made wireframes of the website for different devices.

#### Wireframe for browser window

- Came up with a few names for the site. 
  1. Cambodian Travel Guide.
  2. Khmer Travel Chronicles.
  3. Khmer Explorer.
  4. Cambodia Traveller.
  5. Travel Guide: Cambodia.
  6. Road to Cambodia.
  7. Cambodian Holiday Tips.
Ultimately decided on using Khmer Explorer for the website, as the I felt it showed respect for the Khmer people and culture.
